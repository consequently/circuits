circuits
========

Simple examples for typesetting proof circuits in LaTeX and tikz.  Circuit-Example.pdf shows how they look, and Circuit-Example.tex shows how to typeset them.

The only dependency, in addition to LaTeX 2e, is the package _tikz_ which is a part of [pgf](http://ctan.org/pkg/pgf), available at the CTAN archive.
